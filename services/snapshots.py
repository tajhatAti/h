"""RunSpace workspace snapshots — keeping bot data across a redeploy.

THE PROBLEM
-----------
Each job runs in its own directory on the runner (JOBS_DATA_DIR/<runner_id>).
That directory already survives Stop, Restart and code edits: job_update()
overwrites only main.*, never the data files. So a referral bot's database.db
was safe day to day.

It was NOT safe across a *deploy*. On Render's free tier the container
filesystem is rebuilt from the image, the directory is gone, and the runner
falls back to creating a brand-new job with a brand-new empty workspace. Points,
referral history, session files — all gone. The documented fix was "mount a
Persistent Disk", which requires a paid plan.

THE FIX
-------
Back the workspace up into the one store that IS durable and already paid for:
Postgres. The runner packs its data files into a tar.gz (it is the only process
that can read that filesystem); this module base64s the result into
job_data_snapshots and pushes it back when the workspace comes up empty.

DESIGN NOTES
------------
* Keyed by the SITE job id, not the runner id. The runner id changes every time
  a job is recreated — which is precisely what happens after a deploy — so
  keying by it would lose the very snapshot we need.

* Restore never overwrites an existing file. A live workspace file is always
  fresher than the last snapshot, so overwriting would roll a running bot
  BACKWARDS. After a deploy the directory is empty and everything is written,
  which is the case this exists for.

* Only data is stored. Code lives in the jobs table already, and pylibs/
  node_modules are re-installable and enormous.

* Every entry point is best-effort. A snapshot failure must never stop a job
  from starting — losing a backup is bad, refusing to run the bot is worse.
