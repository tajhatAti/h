"""Push alerts to a user's Telegram when their app changes state.

WHY A WATCHER AND NOT A CALLBACK
--------------------------------
The runner is a separate service (and, with a worker pool, several). It has no
database and no Telegram token — giving it either would spread credentials
across every box and make each worker able to message any user. So the control
plane polls the fleet it already polls for the dashboard and diffs the result.

WHAT IT WILL NOT DO
-------------------
Notify on every tick. A crash-looping app restarts every few seconds; a naive
watcher would send a message each time and the user would mute the bot, which
loses them the alerts that matter. Rules:

  * only STATE TRANSITIONS are announced, never a steady state
  * a repeated transition for the same app is suppressed for a cool-off window
  * the first observation after a restart of THIS process is recorded silently,
    because everything looks like a transition when you have no prior state
