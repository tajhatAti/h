 *   2. theme variables taken from the user's actual Telegram theme
 *   3. ready()/expand() so the webview opens at full height
 *
 * The RunSpace editor, job list, Details page and everything else are reused
 * exactly as they are. If this script decides it is NOT inside Telegram it
 * does nothing at all and the normal website flow runs untouched.

   * 2. The URL Telegram itself appends: it adds #tgWebAppData=... (and
   *    tgWebAppPlatform / tgWebAppVersion) to the webview URL. That is
   *    present the instant the page starts parsing, with no third-party
   *    script involved.
   *
   * THE BUG: only signal 1 existed. telegram-web-app.js is fetched from
   * telegram.org, so when it is slow or blocked, __inTelegram was false, boot
   * fell through to routeFromUrl() on /dashboard — a protected route — and the
   * user got a Sign in / Create account screen INSIDE Telegram. Reproduced:
   *
   *     SDK loaded      -> {inTelegram:true}
   *     SDK not loaded  -> {inTelegram:false}   <- auth screen appears
   *
   * Signal 2 cannot fail that way, so a Telegram webview is now recognised
   * even when Telegram's own script never arrives.
